# Loom3 README Rewrite Outline

## Purpose

This outline is for the new package README.

The goal is:

- keep the main README broad, accurate, and product-facing
- cover every major capability Loom3 actually ships today
- move deep feature details into separate docs instead of bloating the landing document
- keep the viseme / lip-sync / jaw material precise about current behavior while the runtime overhaul tracked in `#100` is still ahead of us

## Main README Principles

- Lead with what Loom3 is, why it exists, and why the abstraction matters.
- Open with the fact that Loom3 creates performant, mixable Three.js character animation that is still easy to compose.
- Show the real public API and the real setup path early.
- Explain the system as a system, not as a bag of unrelated methods.
- Make `AnimationMixer` central to the story, not a footnote.
- Make the FACS-based semantic layer feel like a strength: it is well-defined, reusable, and configurable enough for AI-assisted mapping workflows.
- Put preset/profile fit before advanced runtime control, because readers need to know whether their character matches the mappings first.
- Treat the animation system as a first-class value proposition, not a late appendix.
- Keep CharacterLoom references useful but secondary; they should clarify the product, not narrate documentation assembly.
- Describe current shipped viseme and jaw behavior exactly as it is today.
- Push long tables, edge cases, provider-specific details, and workflow depth into companion docs.

## Current Strategy Updates From May 2026 Review

Use the May 25 issue comments in `#97` and `#98`, the current `origin/main` exports, and the open PR/issue state as the authoritative planning layer for this README pass.

Document as shipped:

- CharacterLoom public links and current drawer tabs: `animation`, `poses`, `gestures`, `speech`, `blink`, `aus`, `visemes`, `tracking`, `hair`, `meshes`, `bones`, `mappings`, `annotations`, and `properties`.
- Profile-first config APIs from `#140`, with old `CharacterConfig` names treated as compatibility aliases.
- Profile-defined viseme slots/bindings, id-based viseme APIs, provider matching helpers, and strongest-active jaw aggregation from `#131` and `#135`.
- Runtime morph target authoring from `#123`.
- Clip lifecycle events from `#120`.
- Baked clip face/body/scene channel metadata and separated baked/generated playback passes from `#114` and `#133`.
- Annotation camera-angle/laterality helpers from `#145`.

Keep as pending or roadmap:

- full provider lip-sync sequence compilation from `#141` / draft PR `#143`
- inherited first-keyframe semantics from `#136` / PR `#142`
- base pose runtime APIs from PR `#138`
- hardened dynamic clip parameter updates from `#116` / PR `#137`
- canonical semantic joint-control authoring/inference APIs from `#108`
- external morph/skin/animation payload rehydration from `#122`
- Rust/Wasm runtime-core investigation from `#146`

## Proposed Main README Sections

### 1. Title and one-paragraph promise

- State what Loom3 is in one clean paragraph.
- Say that it is the expressive runtime and profile layer for performant, mixable Three.js character animation.
- Explain the central abstraction: developers work in expressive semantics instead of rig plumbing.
- Briefly clarify the boundary with CharacterLoom and the internal LoomLarge app/repo.

### 2. Why Loom3 exists

- Explain the problem Loom3 solves.
- Show the gap between raw morph targets / bones and reusable character behavior.
- Summarize the package value in terms of portability, programmability, and remixability.
- Keep this short but sharper than the current generic intro.

### 3. What Loom3 covers

- Give the broad capability map:
- performant, mixable Three.js animation
- semantic runtime control
- profile and preset mapping
- validation and inspection
- animation playback and clip generation
- speech animation and lip sync
- hair and region tooling
- Make clear that Loom3 is more than a face wrapper, but do not dump full API details here.

### 4. Quickstart

- Install `@lovelace_lol/loom3` and `three`.
- Show the minimal Three.js setup with `GLTFLoader`, `collectMorphMeshes`, `Loom3`, and `onReady()`.
- Show the two update ownership patterns:
- external render loop with `update(dt)`
- internal loop with `start()`
- End with one tiny end-to-end example:
- set one AU
- set one viseme
- play one baked animation or one transition

### 5. Core mental model

- Explain the four main pieces:
- model
- preset/profile
- controller
- update/playback loop
- Explain the difference between:
- preset
- profile override
- runtime controller
- clip playback
- direct control
- This section should orient the rest of the README.

### 6. Public surface and package shape

- Clarify the real public exports:
- `Loom3` is the shipped Three.js implementation
- `LoomLarge` is the exported type/interface shape
- built-in presets and helpers come from the package root
- Explain that the runtime contract is still Three.js-shaped today.
- Include one short export map, not a full dump.

### 7. Presets and profiles

- Explain what a preset contains at a high level:
- AU mappings
- bone mappings
- viseme mappings
- mesh routing
- mix defaults
- metadata
- Explain built-in presets:
- `CC4_PRESET`
- `BETTA_FISH_PRESET`
- Explain profile overrides and how they merge.
- Explain naming resolution at a broad level:
- `boneNodes`
- prefix/suffix handling
- morph prefix/suffix behavior
- Keep exact merge and edge-case details for a deeper doc.

### 8. Validate and inspect before authoring

- Explain why preset validation matters before tuning expressions.
- Cover:
- `validateMappingConfig()`
- `validateMappings()`
- `isPresetCompatible()`
- `suggestBestPreset()`
- `generateMappingCorrections()`
- `analyzeModel()`
- `extractFromGLTF()` / `extractModelData()`
- Position this as the recommended workflow before custom mapping work.

### 9. Runtime control overview

- Give the broad map of control surfaces:
- Action Units
- bone rotations and translations
- direct morph control
- continuum pairs
- composite rotations
- mix weights
- Keep this section conceptual and brief.
- Explain when to use each control path.
- Link out to deeper feature docs for per-method depth.

### 10. Action Units

- Explain the FACS-based AU model.
- Show a few concrete examples:
- smile
- brow raise
- blink
- jaw drop
- head turn
- Cover both `setAU()` and `transitionAU()`.
- Briefly mention mixed morph/bone AUs and mix weights.
- Do not inline the full AU catalog in the main README.

### 11. Bone rotations, transformations, and mix weights

- Explain that Loom3 does not only animate morph targets. It also drives bone rotation and translation.
- Explain composite rotations and why they matter for rigs like head, eyes, jaw, and tongue.
- Mention that quaternion composition is what keeps 3D bone rotation stable and interpolatable.
- Briefly link to the 3Blue1Brown quaternion lesson as optional intuition, not required background.
- Explain mix weights clearly:
- morph targets and bone motion can be blended together for the same semantic control
- the blend is configurable per AU
- this is one of the keys to making movement feel realistic instead of rigid

### 12. Direct morph control and continuum pairs

- Explain these as the lower-level or specialized runtime controls.
- Cover when to use:
- `setMorph()` / `transitionMorph()`
- `setContinuum()` / `transitionContinuum()`
- Explain that these are important, but not the first thing a new reader should reach for.

### 13. Lip sync and speech animation

- Use `Lip Sync` or `Lip Sync and Speech Animation` as the user-facing heading.
- Introduce `viseme` as the current low-level API term, not the main reader-facing concept.
- Explain that realistic speech animation needs both lip articulation and jaw motion.
- Explain that changing the relative degree of jaw and lip activation can approximate different speaking styles.
- Say that this idea is explored in the JALI paper and cite it directly.
- Recommend recreating a Loom3-specific diagram inspired by the JALI speech-style graphic rather than relying on unexplained jargon.
- Then explain the current shipped Loom3 truth exactly:
- the shipped CC4 `VISEME_KEYS` order
- compatibility APIs are index-based: `setViseme()` and `transitionViseme()`
- profile-defined slot APIs also ship: `setVisemeById()` and `transitionVisemeById()`
- profile slots can include provider ids, phoneme hints, matchers, and default jaw amounts
- `getVisemeBindingTargets()` and related helpers are the current binding source for live and generated viseme playback
- live jaw coupling now reads profile/slot jaw amounts, with the old private table only as a final fallback
- overlapping live visemes use the strongest active jaw contribution
- Make clear that provider-source modeling and richer speech sequence compilation are still under active overhaul in `#100`, `#86`, `#141`, and draft PR `#143`.
- Do not describe the future model as if it already ships.
- Give readers the correct current behavior plus the broad direction of change.
- Keep provider-specific depth out of the main README.

### 14. Animation system

- This needs to be one of the central sections, not an afterthought.
- Start by saying Loom3 exposes a shared playback model on top of Three.js `AnimationMixer` infrastructure.
- Do not say baked and generated clips all live in one undifferentiated mixer world.
- Be explicit after `#133`: baked source actions and generated/procedural clip actions are evaluated through separate passes so procedural snippets can safely override baked additive face tracks.
- Explain the animation model as a coherent system:
- transitions
- baked animation clips
- snippet / curve-to-clip playback
- shared handles and lifecycle
- Define the terms clearly:
- curve = a value changing over time for an AU, viseme, morph, or other channel
- clip = a mixer-playable animation built from tracks
- snippet = a named bundle of curves that can be turned into a clip and scheduled
- Explain how transition playback differs from mixer-backed clip playback.
- Explain the role of:
- crossfading
- weight/intensity
- playback rate
- loop behavior
- Explain why baked and generated clips are remixable:
- normalized playback/control surface
- separated mixer passes for safe precedence
- same control surfaces
- shared update ownership
- Explain how direct runtime control coexists with clip playback.
- Explain the efficiency and reliability story in plain language.
- Be explicit that the point is not just feature enumeration. This section needs to explain why the system feels coherent instead of accidental.
- Explain that procedural clip generation is valuable because a high-level semantic curve can be compiled down into its constituent morph target activations, bone rotations, and bone translations.
- Include one combined example:
- play a baked clip
- layer a generated clip or snippet
- drive a live AU or viseme on top

### 15. Playback and state control

- Cover:
- pause/resume
- active transition state
- clip handles
- animation handles
- global playback controls
- reset/neutral behavior
- This can stay short if the animation section already explains the architecture.

### 16. Hair physics

- Explain what Loom3 provides here at a broad level.
- Cover registration, configuration, and runtime enable/disable.
- Keep detailed parameter tuning in a dedicated doc.

### 17. Regions, geometry, and annotation helpers

- Explain these as tooling helpers for semantic camera targets, markers, and face anchors.
- Cover:
- `resolveBoneName()`
- `resolveBoneNames()`
- `resolveFaceCenter()`
- `findFaceCenter()`
- orientation helpers
- Keep the current Loom3 versus CharacterLoom annotation boundary accurate.
- Link to the deeper annotation configuration doc instead of inlining every field.

### 18. Skeletal-only and non-human presets

- Keep a dedicated broad section for rigs like the fish preset.
- Explain what this section is really proving:
- Loom3 is not only for CC4 humanoid face rigs
- skeletal-driven expressive mappings are supported
- Use the shipped fish preset structure, not pseudo-API inventions.
- Keep the full fish preset walkthrough in a deeper doc.

### 19. CharacterLoom companion walkthrough

- Keep this optional and concise.
- Use screenshots and links only when they help the reader understand the product.
- Each CharacterLoom reference should answer:
- what the reader is looking at
- why it matters
- what to inspect next
- Remove maintainer-process commentary, capture notes, and stale justifications.
- Remove prose about:
- what the README "should" do
- deep-link limitations
- screenshots being captured before a label refresh
- features not yet moved from a demo/runtime unless that limitation materially changes user understanding
- The walkthrough prose should read like product guidance, not notes from whoever assembled the docs.

### 20. Compact API reference

- End with a compact export-oriented reference.
- Group by:
- runtime
- presets/profiles
- validation
- animation
- tooling/helpers
- Do not turn the bottom of the README into generated docs.

### 21. Further reading

- Link to deeper docs by topic.
- Link to relevant reference material:
- FACS
- ARKit face blend shapes as an example of a different rig vocabulary that can be normalized into semantic mappings
- JALI paper
- Reallusion CC4
- Three.js
- internal Loom3 docs

### 22. License

- Keep this minimal.

## Companion Docs We Should Have

The main README should hand off to a deeper doc set. At minimum we should have:

- `docs/getting-started.md`
- `docs/presets-and-profiles.md`
- `docs/validation-and-model-analysis.md`
- `docs/action-units.md`
- `docs/visemes-and-lip-sync.md`
- `docs/animation-system.md`
- `docs/baked-animations-and-clips.md`
- `docs/hair-physics.md`
- `docs/regions-and-annotations.md`
- `docs/custom-presets.md`
- `docs/skeletal-and-nonhuman-rigs.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## Existing Repo Docs We Can Reuse Or Expand

- `ANNOTATION_CONFIGURATION.md` should become the source for the deeper annotations doc.
- `VISION_AND_PRD.md` should inform the framing and value proposition, but not be pasted directly into the README.
- The viseme research and implementation issues should shape the speech section:
- `#86`
- `#87`
- `#88`
- `#100`
- The animation architecture README work should stay aligned with:
- `#96`
- `#97`
- `#98`

## What Should Not Live In The Main README

- maintainer-process notes
- screenshot capture commentary
- deep-link limitation commentary unless it directly affects usage
- "captured before label refresh" style caveats
- runtime migration status notes unless they change the actual package contract
- stale or approximate pseudo-code presented as shipped code
- provider-specific research detail that belongs in a deeper viseme/lip-sync doc
- exhaustive preset tables that overwhelm first-time readers
- speculative future behavior described as current API behavior

## Inputs Incorporated From Supporting Drafts

These two draft issue notes are now reflected in the outline and should stay as rewrite constraints:

- `/tmp/loom3-animation-playback-docs-issue.md`
- `/tmp/loom3-loomlarge-walkthrough-prose-issue.md`

Concretely, that means:

- the animation section must explain the playback model as a system, not as a method list
- the animation section must explain remixability, efficiency, and reliability in plain language
- the walkthrough prose must explain the product state being shown, not the documentation process
- CharacterLoom screenshots and links need to justify their presence with actual reader value
